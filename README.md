## Description
----
This raytracer displays the following objects: plane, sphere, cylinder, and cone. The lights are colored. We can place multiple cameras. The scenes are defined by a configuration file. The staining system is  [Phong](href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_shading")

#### General structure
```
object_name{
    objet_component object_value        # this is a comment
}

object_value: vector OR float
vector      : 2.0, .56, 0.
float       : 42.1337
```

#### Key_word
| key_word_object |
| :--- | 
| light |
| camera |
| plan |
| sphere |
| cylinder |
| cone |

| key_word_component | value type | 
| :--- | ---: | 
| pos | vector |
| col | vector |
| dir | vector |
| front | vector |
| up | vector |
| value | double |
| spec | double |

| component\object | light | camera | plan | sphere | cylinder | cone |
| :---: |:---: |:---: |:---: |:---: |:---: |:---: |
| pos | ✓ |  ✓ |  ✓ |  ✓ |  ✓ |  ✓ | 
| col | ✓ | |  ✓ |  ✓ |  ✓ |  ✓ |

| up | |  ✓ | | | | |


####  Parsing behavior
- comment begin with `#` and ends at the end of the line
 - the blanc space are separator and several is the same as one
 - the order of the components has no influence
 - If you have a wrong name_object you got an error and the programe stop.
 - if you have a wrong name_composante the composente is ignored
 - if you have several time the same componante the laste is the selected
 - if you have a wrong vector or number parsing the value is 0
 - if you have a missing componante a default value is set
 - the color are caped betwen 0 and 255
 - if the speculare coeeficient `spec` is less than `3.0` it is ignored
